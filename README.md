# Change-Mode
My first Repository:-

Welcome to the Change Mode repository! This project is a simple JavaScript-based application developed as part of my journey to learn front-end development. It demonstrates how to switch between different modes (such as light mode and dark mode) by clicking a button.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
This project includes a basic web page with a button that allows users to toggle between two different visual modes. It showcases the use of JavaScript for DOM manipulation and CSS for styling, providing a fundamental example of how to create interactive and responsive web applications.

FEATURES:
Mode Switching: Click the button to toggle between light mode and dark mode.
Dynamic Styling: Changes in mode reflect immediately with smooth transitions.
User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive user interface designed for ease of use.

TECHNOLOGIES USED:
HTML: For the structure of the web page.
CSS: For styling the different modes.
JavaScript: For adding interactivity and functionality to switch between modes.
